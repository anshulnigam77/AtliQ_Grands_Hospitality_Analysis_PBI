### Overview

AtliQ Grands, a chain of five-star hotels across India, has been facing a decline in market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotel category. This was due to strategic moves from competitors and ineffective decision-making in management.

### Objective

I developed a comprehensive data intelligence solution using Power BI to provide key insights into hotel performance. My task was to calculate critical metrics such as Revenue, Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR), Average Daily Rate (ADR), Occupancy Percentage (occ%), Daily Sellable Room Nights (dsrn), and Realization Percentage (realisation%) across various hotels and cities.

### Action

- **Data Modeling**: Built robust data models in Power BI using data from multiple sources to ensure accurate and efficient data analysis.

- **DAX Measures**: Developed complex DAX measures to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Revenue, RevPAR, ADR, occ%, dsrn, and realisation%.
- **Visualizations**: Created effective and interactive visualizations to present the data insights clearly, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions.

- **Customized Dashboards**: Designed dashboards tailored to the needs of different levels of management, from operational staff to executives, providing both detailed and high-level views of performance metrics.
- **Iterative Feedback**: Implemented an iterative development process with regular feedback loops to continuously refine and improve the dashboards based on user input.

### Result

The implementation of the Power BI solution provided AtliQ Grands with actionable insights into their hotel performance across different cities. Key outcomes included:
- Enhanced visibility into critical performance metrics, allowing for better strategic decision-making.
- Identification of underperforming areas and opportunities for improvement, leading to targeted interventions.
- Improved data-driven decision-making capabilities across management levels, contributing to efforts to regain market share and increase revenue.
